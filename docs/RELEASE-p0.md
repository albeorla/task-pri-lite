# Release P0: Architectural Refactoring

## Release Overview

This release focuses on architectural refactoring to improve the organization, maintainability, and extensibility of the codebase. It establishes a solid foundation for future feature development by implementing a clean architecture approach.

## Architectural Changes

The codebase has been reorganized to follow a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Layer
- Domain models, interfaces, and type definitions
- Core business entities and domain logic
- No dependencies on external libraries or frameworks

### Infrastructure Layer
- External system implementations (storage, services, APIs)
- Adapters for third-party integrations
- Technical concerns like persistence and external communication

### Application Layer
- Application-specific business logic
- Coordination of domain objects and services
- Implementation of use cases and workflows

### Presentation Layer
- User interface implementations (CLI, API)
- Interface adapters for external consumption
- Input/output formatting and user interaction

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- Created new directory structure following clean architecture principles
- Migrated core domain models (Task, Project)
- Migrated core interfaces (Input, Processing, Output, Storage)
- Migrated infrastructure implementations (Storage, LLM Service)
- Migrated application logic (Task Manager, Processors, Prioritizers)
- Updated documentation to reflect the new architecture

### Pending
- Implementation of CLI interface in presentation layer
- Implementation of API interface in presentation layer
- Integration testing for the new architecture
- Documentation updates for API usage

## Benefits of Refactoring

The architectural refactoring provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Enhanced Testability**: Independent layers enable better unit testing with proper mocking and stubbing.
3. **Better Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code by following the established patterns.
4. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Elimination of circular dependencies and better organization reduces technical debt.
5. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can more easily understand the system structure and where to make changes.

## Known Issues

- Some imports might need to be updated in existing code that was not part of the refactoring process.
- Integration tests may be temporarily non-functional until updated for the new architecture.

## Next Steps

1. Implement presentation layer components
2. Update integration tests
3. Complete API documentation
4. Deploy refactored application to staging environment
