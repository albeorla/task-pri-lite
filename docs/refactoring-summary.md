# Folder Structure Migration Summary

## Migration Overview

The folder structure migration has been completed successfully, implementing a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns. This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for future development while preserving the core business logic.

## Completed Migration Tasks

### Phase 1: Created New Directory Structure
- Created `core` subdirectories for interfaces, models, and types
- Created `infrastructure` subdirectories for storage, services, and adapters
- Created `application` subdirectories for processors, managers, and services
- Created `presentation` subdirectories for CLI and API interfaces

### Phase 2: Core Domain Migration
- Migrated core interfaces into separate files:
  - `input.ts` for input-related interfaces
  - `processing.ts` for processing-related interfaces
  - `output.ts` for output-related interfaces
  - `storage.ts` for storage-related interfaces
- Consolidated models:
  - Migrated `Task` and related enums to `core/models/task.ts`
  - Migrated `Project` to `core/models/project.ts`
- Moved enums to `core/types/enums.ts`
- Created barrel export files for each directory

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Migration
- Migrated storage implementation:
  - Moved `FileStorageService` to `infrastructure/storage/file-storage.ts`
  - Extended to implement the `IStorageService` interface
- Migrated service implementations:
  - Moved `LangChainLLMService` to `infrastructure/services/llm-service.ts`
  - Prepared adapters directory for future implementations

### Phase 4: Application Logic Migration
- Migrated processors:
  - Moved GTD processor to `application/processors/gtd-processor.ts`
  - Moved Eisenhower prioritizer to `application/processors/eisenhower-prioritizer.ts`
- Migrated managers:
  - Moved `TaskManager` to `application/managers/task-manager.ts`
- Created application services:
  - Added `InputProcessingService` to `application/services/input-processing.ts`
  - Added `OutputHandlingService` to `application/services/output-handling.ts`

### Phase 5: Utils Migration
- Created barrel export file for utils directory

### Phase 6: Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with new structure information
- Created RELEASE-p0.md with architectural refactoring details
- Created this refactoring summary document

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration of additional components:
   - Create CLI interface in presentation layer
   - Create API interface in presentation layer
   - Update import paths in entry point files

2. Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each layer
   - Update existing integration tests for the new architecture

3. Documentation:
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add usage examples for the new architecture
