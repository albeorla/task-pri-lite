# Project Setup Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to set up the Task Priority Lite project, a TypeScript-based system for processing various types of input and routing them to appropriate destinations.

## Setup Steps Completed

### 1. GitHub CLI Installation
- Installed GitHub CLI (gh) version 2.69.0
- Added the GitHub CLI repository and GPG key
- Verified installation with `gh --version`

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration
- Created `.env.example` template file with placeholders for sensitive information
- Created `.env` file for actual secrets
- Created `load_env.sh` script to load environment variables
- Made the script executable with `chmod +x`

### 3. Git Configuration
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive files
- Configured to ignore:
  - Environment variables (.env)
  - Security keys and certificates
  - IDE and editor files
  - Dependency directories
  - Build outputs
  - OS-specific files

### 4. Repository Structure Verification
- Verified the existing repository structure
- Identified key directories and files:
  - src/ (source code)
  - docs/ (documentation)
  - package.json and package-lock.json (npm configuration)
  - tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)

### 5. Project Dependencies Setup
- Verified and updated project dependencies with `npm install`
- Confirmed all packages are up to date with no vulnerabilities

### 6. TypeScript Compilation Error Fixes
- Fixed import path issues in multiple files
  - Changed './abstract_base_classes' to '../abstracts/abstract-base-classes'
  - Changed './core_interfaces' to '../core/core-interfaces'
- Added missing properties (source, rawContent, timestamp) to input item classes
- Fixed implicit any type issues by adding proper type annotations
- Updated import statements to reference interfaces directly from core-interfaces.ts
- Successfully built the project with `npm run build`

### 7. Project Environment Configuration
- Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation
- Created setup.sh script to automate environment setup
- Made the script executable
- Tested the setup process

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the setup script: `./setup.sh`
3. Update the .env file with your actual secrets

### Development
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Run development mode: `npm run dev`
3. Start the application: `npm run start`

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code
  - `abstracts/` - Abstract base classes
  - `core/` - Core interfaces and types
  - `examples/` - Implementation examples
  - `handlers/` - Destination handlers
  - `inputs/` - Input item classes
  - `processors/` - Input processors
  - `services/` - Orchestration services
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript (generated after build)

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Ensure Node.js (v20.18.0 or later) is installed
2. Verify all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
3. Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run build`
4. Ensure environment variables are properly set in the .env file
