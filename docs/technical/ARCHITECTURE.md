# System Architecture

Task Priority Lite follows the Clean Architecture pattern with distinct layers that separate concerns and enable flexibility in implementation details.

## Clean Architecture Layers

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CoreLayer {
        Domain Models
        Interfaces
    }
    class ApplicationLayer {
        Use Cases
        Business Logic
    }
    class InfrastructureLayer {
        External Services
        Storage
    }
    class PresentationLayer {
        CLI
        Future API/UI
    }
    
    PresentationLayer --> ApplicationLayer
    ApplicationLayer --> CoreLayer
    InfrastructureLayer --> CoreLayer
```

### Core Layer
- Contains domain entities (Task, Project, Event)
- Defines repository and service interfaces
- Independent of external frameworks or implementation details

### Application Layer
- Implements business logic and use cases
- Orchestrates domain objects
- Contains processors (GTD classification, priority calculation)
- Depends only on the Core layer

### Infrastructure Layer
- Implements interfaces defined in Core
- Contains concrete implementations of repositories and services
- Handles external integration (FileStorageService)
- Adapters for external services

### Presentation Layer
- Currently a Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Future: REST API, Web Dashboard
- Depends on Application layer for functionality

## Current Data Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Python Exporters] -->|JSON Files| B(FileStorageService)
    B --> C{Task Processors}
    C --> D[GTD Classification]
    C --> E[Priority Assignment]
    D --> F[(Output Files)]
    E --> F
```

1. Python exporters fetch data from external services (Todoist, Google Calendar)
2. Data is saved as JSON files in the output directory
3. TypeScript application loads files via FileStorageService
4. Task processors apply business logic (classification, prioritization)
5. Results are stored back to files

## Future Architecture Evolution

See our [Technical Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for details on the planned evolution toward:
- Service-based integration (REST/GraphQL)
- Database storage (SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Performance optimizations (Go/Rust components)
