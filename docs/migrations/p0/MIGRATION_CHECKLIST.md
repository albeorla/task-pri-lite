# Documentation Migration Checklist

## Directory Structure Changes
- [x] Create directories:
  - [x] docs/product/
  - [x] docs/product/releases/
  - [x] docs/technical/
  - [x] docs/technical/API/
  - [x] docs/technical/decisions/
  - [x] docs/technical/decisions/ADRs/
  - [x] docs/guides/

## File Migrations
- [x] Move existing files to new locations:
  - [x] Move PRD.md → product/PRD.md
  - [x] Move RELEASE-p0.md → product/releases/RELEASE-p0.md
- [x] Create new files with templates:
  - [x] Update README.md with new content
  - [x] Create product/ROADMAP.md
  - [x] Create product/releases/CHANGELOG.md
  - [x] Create technical/ARCHITECTURE.md
  - [x] Create technical/API/SPECIFICATION.md
  - [x] Create technical/DEVELOPMENT.md
  - [x] Create technical/decisions/ADRs/001-clean-architecture.md
  - [x] Create guides/onboarding.md

## Special Considerations
- [x] Evaluate content in final_rec.md for integration
  - Decision: Move to technical/ARCHITECTURE-RECOMMENDATIONS.md (contains detailed architecture analysis)
- [x] Review exporters/ directory contents for potential migration
  - Decision: Keep in current location as it contains a complete Python project with dependencies

## Architecture Alignment with ARCHITECTURE-RECOMMENDATIONS.md
- [ ] Document current architecture implementations:
  - [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect Clean Architecture layers (Core, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
  - [ ] Create technical/decisions/ADRs/002-python-typescript-integration.md to document current file-based integration
  - [ ] Create technical/decisions/ADRs/003-storage-strategy.md to document the current FileStorageService approach
- [ ] Document future architecture evolution plans:
  - [ ] Create technical/ROADMAP.md with migration path toward:
    - [ ] Service-based integration (REST/GraphQL APIs)
    - [ ] Database storage (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) migration
    - [ ] Potential Go/Rust implementations for performance-critical components

## Validation
- [x] Verify all links work
- [x] Ensure mermaid diagrams render properly
- [x] Check table formatting

## Migration Completed ✅
The documentation structure has been successfully reorganized according to the provided template. All files have been created with the appropriate content and organized in a logical hierarchy. 

The additional architecture alignment tasks need to be completed to fully integrate the recommendations from ARCHITECTURE-RECOMMENDATIONS.md.
