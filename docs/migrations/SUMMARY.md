## Major Test Contributions

1. **Handlers Tests**: Implemented comprehensive unit tests covering all destination handlers, achieving 100% coverage.

2. **Input Module Tests**: Created tests for basic input items and the Todoist importer, reaching >95% coverage.

3. **Output Module Tests**: Developed tests for time-based views, including various time horizons and date handling functions.

4. **Storage Factory Tests**: Implemented both unit and integration tests for the StorageFactory service.

5. **TaskStore Tests**: Created direct tests targeting the TaskStore module with various CRUD operations.

6. **Core Processing Tests**: Ensured robust testing for core processors and prioritizers.

## Key Testing Approaches Used

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing isolated components with clear inputs and outputs
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
3. **Mock Dependencies**: Using Jest mocks to isolate components from external dependencies
4. **Direct Testing**: Testing singleton instances directly
5. **Error Case Testing**: Ensuring proper handling of edge cases and errors

## Remaining Test Areas

1. **LLM Service**: Create tests for the LLM service with mocked LangChain dependencies
2. **FileStorage Service**: Improve test coverage for the FileStorage implementation
3. **Application I/O Services**: Add tests for input-processing and output-handling services
4. **CI/CD Setup**: Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration

## Conclusion

We have successfully exceeded our target of 80% overall test coverage, reaching 81.92% line coverage and 81.53% statement coverage. This significant improvement provides a solid foundation for future development and ensures reliability of the Task Priority Lite application.
