# Next Steps for Testing Completion

## Phase 1: Input Module Tests (Priority: High)

### 1. Basic Input Items
- Create comprehensive tests for `TextInputItem`
- Create comprehensive tests for `ManualTaskInputItem`
- Test serialization/deserialization
- Test input validation
- Target >80% coverage

### 2. Todoist Import
- Test Todoist task parsing
- Test task mapping
- Test project mapping
- Test error handling for malformed Todoist data
- Target >80% coverage

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Services (Priority: High)

### 1. Storage Factory Service
- Test factory creation
- Test service selection logic
- Test configuration handling
- Test error handling for invalid configuration
- Target 100% coverage

### 2. LLM Service
- Create tests with mocked LangChain dependencies
- Test prompt construction
- Test response handling
- Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Target >80% coverage

## Phase 3: TaskStore Tests (Priority: Medium)

### 1. TaskStore Implementation
- Test task creation and storage
- Test task retrieval
- Test task updates
- Test task deletion
- Test concurrent access patterns
- Target >80% coverage

## Phase 4: Output Module Tests (Priority: Medium)

### 1. Time-based Views
- Test view generation for different time periods
- Test date-based filtering
- Test formatting and output generation
- Test error handling
- Target >80% coverage

## Phase 5: CI/CD Setup (Priority: Medium)

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Set up workflow file for test execution
- Configure Node.js environment
- Configure caching for dependencies
- Run tests on pull requests and merges to main branch

### 2. Test Coverage Enforcement
- Configure Jest coverage thresholds
- Set minimum coverage levels:
  - Statements: 80%
  - Branches: 75% 
  - Functions: 80%
  - Lines: 80%
- Generate coverage reports
- Fail builds that don't meet thresholds

### 3. Linting and Formatting
- Configure ESLint checks in CI
- Configure Prettier checks in CI
- Fail builds with linting or formatting issues

## Completion Criteria

- All tests pass with `yarn verify` command
- Overall test coverage above 80% for statements and lines
- No linting errors or warnings
- CI/CD pipeline successfully configured and running on GitHub
- Documentation updated with final test coverage metrics
