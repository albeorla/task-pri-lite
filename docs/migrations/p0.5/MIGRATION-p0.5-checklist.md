  - [ ] Configure report generation
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
  - [ ] Create workflow to run tests on pull requests
  - [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI process
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
  - [ ] Ensure tests pass before commits
  - [ ] Verify code formatting and linting

**G. Documentation**

- [x] Document test patterns and approaches
  - [x] Create test documentation for developers
  - [x] Document mocking strategies
- [ ] Update API documentation with test examples
- [x] Update migration status documentation
  - [x] Add Phase 0.5 to the status report
  - [x] Document test coverage achievements

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **First Milestone: Fix Types and Get Existing Tests Passing**
   - ‚úÖ Focus on making existing code type-safe
   - ‚úÖ Fix enum mappings and interface issues
   - ‚úÖ Achieve passing tests for existing test files
   - üîÑ Progress: Completed for storage layer (infrastructure/storage), but more work needed in other areas

2. **Second Milestone: Core Model Testing**
   - üîÑ Start with the foundational domain models
   - ‚è≥ Ensure serialization/deserialization works correctly
   - ‚è≥ Test all model associations and relationships

3. **Third Milestone: Infrastructure Layer**
   - ‚úÖ Test data access components thoroughly
   - ‚úÖ Focus on file loading, validation, and mapping
   - ‚úÖ Test error handling for infrastructure components

4. **Fourth Milestone: Application and Integration**
   - ‚è≥ Test higher-level application logic
   - ‚è≥ Verify correct orchestration and processing
   - ‚è≥ Test cross-component integration

5. **Final Milestone: CI/CD and Documentation**
   - ‚è≥ Set up continuous integration
   - ‚è≥ Implement coverage enforcement
   - üîÑ Complete all documentation updates

## **Progress Summary**

We have significantly improved the test coverage and code quality in the infrastructure/storage layer:

1. Fixed the enum mapping issues in loaders to use the correct TaskStatus and EisenhowerQuadrant values
2. Achieved 100% test coverage for schema-validator.ts
3. Significantly improved test coverage for todoist-loader.ts (96.6%), calendar-loader.ts (85.5%), and external-data-source.ts (86%)
4. All 39 tests in the storage module are now passing

Next, we need to focus on testing the core models and then move on to the application layer testing.
