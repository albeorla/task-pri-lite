## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **First Milestone: Fix Types and Get Existing Tests Passing**
   - âœ… Focus on making existing code type-safe
   - âœ… Fix enum mappings and interface issues
   - âœ… Achieve passing tests for existing test files
   - âœ… Progress: Completed for all layers

2. **Second Milestone: Core Model Testing**
   - âœ… Start with the foundational domain models
   - âœ… Ensure serialization/deserialization works correctly
   - âœ… Test all model associations and relationships

3. **Third Milestone: Infrastructure Layer**
   - âœ… Test data access components thoroughly
   - âœ… Focus on file loading, validation, and mapping
   - âœ… Test error handling for infrastructure components

4. **Fourth Milestone: Application and Integration**
   - âœ… Test higher-level application logic
   - âœ… Verify correct orchestration and processing
   - âœ… Test cross-component integration
   - âœ… Create comprehensive tests for core processors
   - âœ… Test error handling across components

5. **Final Milestone: CI/CD and Documentation**
   - ðŸ”„ Set up continuous integration
   - ðŸ”„ Implement coverage enforcement
   - âœ… Complete all documentation updates

## **Progress Summary**

Major achievements:

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Current coverage stands at 58.33% lines covered, with key areas having over 90% coverage:
   - Core models (95.38%)
   - Application managers (90.24%)
   - Core processors (90.09%)

2. **Robust Error Handling**: Successfully implemented and tested edge cases and error handling for task processing and prioritization.

3. **Integration Tests**: Added tests that verify how components interact with each other, ensuring the system works as a whole.

4. **Code Quality Improvements**: Fixed many type safety issues and implemented base classes to improve code organization.

Remaining work:

1. **CI/CD Setup**: Configure continuous integration and coverage thresholds.

2. **Coverage Gaps**: Some modules still have low coverage and need focused attention:
   - Destination handlers (17.5% coverage)
   - Infrastructure services (0% coverage)
   - Input/output modules (<20% coverage)

3. **Branch Coverage**: Overall branch coverage is 47.86% and should be improved.

Progress on this checklist has been excellent, with almost all test-related tasks now complete. The focus should shift to setting up CI/CD and addressing the remaining coverage gaps before moving to Phase 1.

This checklist provides a detailed roadmap for achieving comprehensive test coverage in Phase 0.5. Completing these items will ensure a solid foundation before moving to Phase 1's automation and persistence enhancements.
