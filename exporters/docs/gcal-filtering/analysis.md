# Filtering Criteria Analysis

## 1. Document Analysis: "Life Goals: A Balanced Perspective"

The document outlines a comprehensive framework for life goals and task prioritization. It uses:
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as a framework
- Core goal areas categorized into three main groups
- The Eisenhower Matrix for task prioritization
- Current focus areas as of April 6, 2025

### Key Goal Categories:
1. **Foundational Pillars** (Maslow's Physiological & Safety Needs):
   - Physical Health
   - Mental Health
   - Financial Stability

2. **Core Connections** (Maslow's Love & Belonging Needs):
   - Healthy Marriage
   - Social Connection

3. **Growth & Aspirations** (Maslow's Esteem & Self-Actualization Needs):
   - Career Progression
   - Home Ownership
   - Children (potential future goal)

### Current Focus Areas (April 6, 2025):
- Financial Stability (primary focus)
- Career Progression/Job Search (parallel key priority)
- Physical Health (active area requiring attention)
- Healthy Marriage (crucial contextually)
- Mental Health (essential for navigating priorities)

### Eisenhower Matrix Categories:
1. **Urgent & Important (Do First)**:
   - Immediate financial actions
   - Time-sensitive personal/health tasks
   - Immediate Career/Income tasks

2. **Important & Not Urgent (Schedule)**:
   - Foundational planning
   - Long-term health/well-being
   - Relationship-focused actions
   - Tasks with future due dates

3. **Urgent & Not Important (Delegate/Minimize/Automate)**:
   - Tasks that feel urgent but don't align with core goals
   - Administrative tasks that could be streamlined

4. **Not Urgent & Not Important (Delete/Defer)**:
   - Items in "backlog" project
   - Vague or outdated tasks

## 2. JSON Files Structure Analysis

### calendar_planning.json:
- Contains calendar events in a nested structure
- Each calendar has attributes like:
  - calendar_id
  - description
  - time_zone
  - color information
  - access_role
  - items array containing individual events

- Each event item has attributes like:
  - item_id
  - type
  - content (title/summary)
  - description
  - status
  - start_date and end_date
  - timezone
  - is_all_day
  - is_recurring
  - source_link
  - attendees
  - organizer information
  - reminders

### calendar_events.json:
- Events organized by calendar name
- Each event has attributes like:
  - id
  - summary
  - description
  - location
  - status
  - start and end dates
  - all_day flag
  - created and updated timestamps

## 3. Filtering Criteria Extraction

Based on the document analysis, I can extract the following filtering criteria:

### Primary Filtering Criteria:

1. **Goal Alignment**: 
   - Keep events that align with the current focus areas:
     - Financial Stability
     - Career Progression/Job Search
     - Physical Health
     - Healthy Marriage
     - Mental Health

2. **Urgency & Importance** (Eisenhower Matrix):
   - Prioritize events categorized as:
     - Urgent & Important (Do First)
     - Important & Not Urgent (Schedule)
   - Potentially filter out or deprioritize:
     - Urgent & Not Important (unless they cannot be delegated)
     - Not Urgent & Not Important

3. **Time Relevance**:
   - Keep events that are current or upcoming
   - Filter out past events unless they have recurring significance

### Secondary Filtering Criteria:

4. **Event Type Relevance**:
   - Keep personal appointments, meetings, and tasks
   - Keep health-related appointments
   - Keep financial and career-related events
   - Keep relationship-building events (marriage, social connections)
   - Consider filtering out generic holidays unless they impact planning

5. **Status-based Filtering**:
   - Keep events with "confirmed" status
   - Filter out events with "cancelled" status

## 4. Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Multi-category Events**: 
   - Events that span multiple goal categories (e.g., a financial meeting with spouse that affects both Financial Stability and Healthy Marriage)
   - Solution: Tag with multiple categories and prioritize based on primary focus area

2. **Recurring Events**: 
   - Events that repeat but may have varying importance
   - Solution: Evaluate each instance based on proximity to current date and alignment with current focus areas

3. **Long-duration Events**: 
   - Events that span multiple days or weeks
   - Solution: Evaluate based on start date proximity and overall goal alignment

4. **Vague Event Descriptions**: 
   - Events with unclear descriptions that make categorization difficult
   - Solution: Implement confidence scoring and flag for manual review if below threshold

5. **Changing Priorities**: 
   - The document indicates that focus areas may shift over time
   - Solution: Include timestamp of filtering and allow for reprocessing when priorities change

## 5. Implementation Process with LangChain and Claude's API:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load both JSON files
   - Normalize data structures between the two files
   - Create a unified data model for consistent processing

2. **Criteria Definition**:
   - Define the filtering criteria as a structured prompt for Claude
   - Include examples of how to categorize different types of events

3. **Event Processing Pipeline**:
   - Process each event through Claude API using LangChain
   - For each event:
     - Extract key information (title, description, dates, etc.)
     - Send to Claude with the filtering criteria prompt
     - Receive classification and confidence score
     - Make keep/filter decision based on classification

4. **Post-processing and Consolidation**:
   - Combine retained events from both sources
   - Deduplicate events that appear in both files
   - Sort by date and priority
   - Structure according to output JSON schema

5. **Validation and Edge Case Handling**:
   - Implement validation checks for the processed data
   - Flag edge cases for review
   - Handle special cases like recurring events appropriately
