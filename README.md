# Task Priority Lite

A system for processing various types of input (text, tasks, etc.) and routing them to appropriate destinations.

## Project Setup

This project has been set up with the following components:

- GitHub CLI for repository management
- Environment variables for secrets management
- Git configuration to ignore sensitive files
- TypeScript configuration for development

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.18.0 or later)
- npm (included with Node.js)
- TypeScript (installed as a project dependency)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run development mode with watch:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture approach with the following structure:

- `src/` - Source code
  - `core/` - Core domain model
    - `interfaces/` - Core interfaces
    - `models/` - Domain models
    - `types/` - Type definitions and enums
  - `infrastructure/` - External systems implementations
    - `storage/` - Storage implementations
    - `services/` - External service implementations
    - `adapters/` - Adapters for external systems
  - `application/` - Application business logic
    - `processors/` - Task processing logic
    - `managers/` - Domain object managers
    - `services/` - Application services
  - `presentation/` - User interface implementations
    - `cli/` - Command-line interfaces
    - `api/` - API interfaces
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
  - `config/` - Configuration files
- `docs/` - Documentation
  - `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
  - `RELEASE-p0.md` - Release documentation
- `output/` - Output files generated by the application
- `data/` - Storage directory for local data

## Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update with your actual secrets:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your actual values.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `npm run start` - Run the compiled JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Run TypeScript in watch mode for development

## Documentation

The project documentation is organized as follows:

- `docs/prd.md` - The Product Requirements Document (PRD) that outlines the system architecture, components, and requirements.
- `pm/P0_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_AND_PLAN.md` - A consolidated document that tracks the P0 implementation status and provides an action plan for completing the MVP.

Redundant or outdated documentation has been archived in the `docs/archive/` directory.
