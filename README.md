# Task Priority Lite

A system for processing tasks from various sources (Todoist, Google Calendar) using GTD principles for prioritization and organization.

## Project Setup

This project has been set up with the following components:

- TypeScript core application with Clean Architecture
- Python exporters for Todoist and Google Calendar
- JSON schema validation for data integrity
- File-based data exchange between components

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.18.0 or later)
- npm (included with Node.js)
- Python 3.10+
- Todoist account and API token
- Google Calendar account and OAuth credentials

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install TypeScript dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Python environment:
   ```bash
   cd exporters
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Configure credentials:
   - Follow the instructions in `docs/USAGE.md` to set up Todoist and Google Calendar credentials

5. Run exporters and application:
   ```bash
   # Run exporters first to generate data files
   cd exporters
   python -m todoist_data_exporter.cli export
   python -m google_calendar_exporter.main
   
   # Then run the TypeScript application
   cd ..
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture approach with the following structure:

- `src/` - TypeScript core application
  - `core/` - Core domain model
    - `interfaces/` - Core interfaces
    - `models/` - Domain models
    - `types/` - Type definitions and enums
  - `infrastructure/` - External systems implementations
    - `storage/` - Storage implementations including file loaders
    - `services/` - External service implementations
    - `adapters/` - Adapters for external systems
  - `application/` - Application business logic
    - `processors/` - Task processing logic
    - `managers/` - Domain object managers
    - `services/` - Application services
  - `presentation/` - User interface implementations
    - `cli/` - Command-line interfaces
    - `api/` - API interfaces
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
  - `config/` - Configuration files
- `exporters/` - Python exporters for external services
  - `todoist/` - Todoist data exporter
  - `google-calendar/` - Google Calendar exporter
  - `schemas/` - JSON schemas for data validation
- `docs/` - Documentation
  - `migrations/` - Migration documentation
  - `USAGE.md` - User guide for setting up and using the application
- `output/` - Output files generated by exporters and application
- `data/` - Storage directory for local data

## Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in both the root directory and the exporters directory, then update with your actual secrets:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cd exporters
cp .env.example .env
```

## Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `npm run start` - Run the compiled JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Run TypeScript in watch mode for development
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests

## Documentation

The project documentation is organized as follows:

- `docs/USAGE.md` - Detailed guide for setting up and using the application
- `docs/migrations/p0/` - Documentation for Phase 0 migration (file-based integration)
  - `MIGRATION-p0-overview.md` - Overview of the Phase 0 migration approach
  - `MIGRATION-p0-checklist.md` - Checklist of tasks for the Phase 0 migration

## Migration Status

The project is currently in Phase 0 of its migration plan, which implements a file-based integration between Python exporters and the TypeScript core application. All items on the Phase 0 checklist have been completed, including unit tests and documentation.
